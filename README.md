# Vivek Patel

## Who am I and where did I come from?

Hello there! My name is Vivek and professionally I am a Software Engineer. I currently live in Austin, TX.
I was born in India and lived there for the first 10 years of my life. My family then moved to Texas and then to Connecticut and then back to Texas before settling down in New Braunfels, TX - this little town is about 30 minutes out of San Antonio and what I considered 'home' for a big part of my childhood/teenage years. I attended the University of Texas at Austin and ended up living there for nearly 10 years and is what I consider 'home' at this point in my life!

I've always been a techy person, I still remember the moment my dad buying me my first computer when I was 11. I was at a friends house for a sleepover and when I came home there was a brand new computer all set up, I instantly broke down in tears! My first tinkering with programming came with modding videogames and trying to figure out how to get console games to work on a PC. I think there were moments when my parents probably regretted getting me a computer, but it all worked out - I wouldn't be where I am right now without those events.

## How do I do my Best Work?

### Burst of Inspirations
There will be random moments through out the day where I feel incredibly productive and motivated. My goal is to capture as many of those moments as possible

### Asking Questions
Whenever I get stuck, my first instinct is to ask someone why I am stuck. Sometimes its a 'rubber duck' situation and sometimes I truly just need someone to tell me how to fix the problem. This is probably where I get the most self conscious because I feel like I am bothering people while they are doing their own work.

### Zooming out
Once I am familiar in an environment, I am strong at zooming out of a problem and figure out how a solution could impact various touchpoints of a system. I like thinking about these potential problems and finding clever solutions to avoid them.

## Communication style
Any! I am open to any and all types of communication, Zoom/Slack/Phone maybe anything expect email.

I also am 100% open to anyone reaching out to me at anytime (I may not reply very fast after hours).

There are no expectations of 'instant replies' especailly in a remote work world.

## What I value

### Curiousity
Learning new things is something that drives me. I love it when people around me are also curious about things, asking why something happens the way it does - or figuring out how something should be. My most recent 'curiousity' related obsession has been trying to learn Japanese on Duolingo

### Development
This is similar to 'Curiosity' but I think it deserves its own slot here because career development is a high priority for me. For myself and the people around me! I want to help push people to their goals and vice versa.

### Feedback
I love an appreciate feedback on anything that I do, this helps me grow! I also am always learning new ways of providing feedback to others. Open communication and being comfortable with others to a degree where feedback is exchanged safely.

When receiving constructive feedback, I want to grow from the exchange - I like examples of how I can do better and would love follow up in the future whether I have improved or not.
When giving feedback, I like to be direct but will always be encouraging. Similar to how I like to receive feedback, I will try to provide examples of improvement. If its code related feedback, many times I like to dive into a collaboration session since I find that to be most productive.

## Goals

### Level Up
Learn more ways on how things can scale, learn new technological options out there, learn about different paradigms and ideas and thoughts.

### Release an application that I make/come up with
Super longterm goal - I have a long way to go before I can get there. I want to commit 100% of time to making something, idea TBD, and see where I can go.

### Ski down some double black diamond runs
..without breaking a leg or dying or anything like that.
